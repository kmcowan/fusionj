So for example you want a unlocked new iPhone 5s, for this you would buy it from Apple directly.&nbsp; Then you can use it with whatever Carrier you want (that also supports the 5s phone).&nbsp;<BR /><BR />The good news is AT&amp;T does allow you to unlock your devices as long as you meet certain requirements.&nbsp; I had my Lumia 900 unlocked after about a year of using it on my GoPhone account.&nbsp; You just have to head over to this link:<BR /><BR /><A target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/client/en_US/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">AT&amp;T Device Unlock Request</A></P><P>Hope this helps<img class=\"emoticon emoticon-smileyhappy\" id=\"smileyhappy\" src=\"https://cng.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.png\" alt=\"Smiley Happy\" title=\"Smiley Happy\" /></P>"
